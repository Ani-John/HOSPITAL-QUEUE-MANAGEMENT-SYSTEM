# HOSPITAL-QUEUE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
A platform that expedites scheduling of appointments for patients

Problem Statement: Patients in Nigerian government hospitals wait over 3 hours to see a doctor due to manual processes and inefficient scheduling systems.

GC/GO Link: This issue directly relates to the Global Challenge of Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3).

Why It Matters: This problem affects millions, especially pregnant women, the elderly, and children. Long queues, exhaustion, and missed care degrade the overall healthcare experience and contribute to preventable health risks.
